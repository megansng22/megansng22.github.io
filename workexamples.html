    <h1>This section is dedicated to my projects:</h1> 
    <h2>YouServe: YouServe is a website project that I developed as part of the Girls Who Code program and is dedicated to connecting volunteers with various volunteer organizations based on their interests, availabilities, and proximity. This project uses a mixture of HTML and CSS to uphold a website that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</h2>
    <h2>Senior Thesis Website: As a developer on the technology team of the Honors College, my team and I are developing a website that allows for seniors of the college to present their thesis projects. This website will also showcase these projects and allow for their creators to interact with other students, professors, and alumni as well.</h2>
    <h2>Tripplar: Tripplar is a mobile app designed to support small and local businesses during these unprecedented times. Tripplar matches consumers up with local businesses in the San Jose area based on their interests, purchasing preferences, and even their friends who have shown interest in the same businesses.</h2>
